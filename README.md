### osTicket – Ticket Lifecycle and Help Desk Workflow

This project demonstrates how tickets move through a real IT support workflow using osTicket.  
Instead of showing every small detail, this write-up focuses on the key actions that matter in real help desk environments, why they are important, and the skills learned from performing them.


### What This Project Covers
- Creating tickets from the end-user portal  
- Reviewing and classifying issues  
- Setting the correct SLA and priority  
- Assigning tickets to the right team  
- Troubleshooting technical problems  
- Documenting updates and resolutions  
- Closing tickets properly  

These steps simulate the full lifecycle a help desk agent follows.

- Closed the ticket once the system was working again



  

### Why these actions matter  
Major outages impact many users, so classifying them correctly ensures they are handled immediately.  
Documenting the steps helps the team understand what happened and prevents repeated mistakes.

### Skills Learned  
- Prioritizing high-impact issues  
- Using SLAs correctly  
- Routing issues to the right team  
- Troubleshooting system-wide outages  
- Writing clear technical updates  


### Scenario 2 – Adobe Software Not Working (Low Impact)

### What Happened  
Several accounting users could not open Adobe Reader.

### Key Actions 
<img width="760" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0eb4d7b-7d83-4111-b7fd-b362c0915e01" />

- create ticket
- Reviewed the ticket  

  <img width="1512" height="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c18b9fe-2dbc-4ae5-b7c2-18896fa42506" />

- Set the SLA to a low-priority option (Sev-C)  
- Assigned the ticket to the appropriate agent  
- Performed simple troubleshooting and confirmed a restart fixed the issue  
- Documented the solution and closed the ticket
  


### Why these actions matter  
Most help desk issues are minor, and correctly classifying them prevents them from delaying more important work.  
Simple fixes still need clear documentation so the next agent knows what was done.

### Skills Learned  
- Handling day-to-day support requests  
- Using SLAs to separate minor issues from critical ones  
- Basic software troubleshooting  
- Writing accurate resolution notes  


### Scenario 3 – CFO’s Laptop Not Working (High Impact User Issue)

### What Happened  
A ticket was submitted because the CFO’s laptop would not turn on.

### Key Actions  
  <img width="1506" height="958" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/338d7ad1-7051-4740-a2ac-b7dbe7e25269" />

- created ticket
- Reviewed the ticket and understood who it affected
 
  <img width="1469" height="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26b31f96-70ff-42a9-966f-08991559d275" />

- Set a more urgent SLA (Sev-B) because it involved an executive  
- Investigated the issue  
- Found the problem was a broken charger  
- Replaced the charger and confirmed the laptop worked  
- Documented the fix and resolved the ticket


### Why these actions Matter  
Even simple problems become high impact when they involve critical users.  
Learning to evaluate impact, not just the technical problem, is an important help desk skill.
